        "An aggressive return target of 900% in ultra-short term necessitates leveraging a solid, high-liquidity asset like BTC.",
        "BTC's price volatility on short time frames can be advantageous for a day trader looking to capitalize on price movements within the user's risk profile.",
        "Leverage is adjusted slightly below the user's average to account for intermediate experience level, ensuring a buffer against market volatility while aiming for aggressive returns."

      "The dichotomy in experience levels between spot and perp trading necessitates a cautious yet strategic leverage use, ensuring alignment with aggressive targets while mitigating undue risk.",
      "Given the aggressive return targets, continuous market analysis and risk reassessment is essential, particularly in response to major market movements or volatility spikes.",
      "Diversification within the suggested bounds (ETH for spot and BTC for perps) addresses the aggressive growth pursuit while managing risk through portfolio balance."
