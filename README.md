=== Welcome to Theseus Alpha Trading System ===
Analyzing your complete trading profile...

1. Focus on Spot Trading Only
2. Focus on Perpetual Trading Only
3. Trade Both Markets (Recommended for your profile)
```
- **Story Mode:**
```
"Welcome, brave adventurer, to Theseus Alpha, a mythological realm where you‚Äôll journey through the world of on-chain trading. Guided by Zeus, Poseidon, and Ares, you‚Äôll make critical decisions to grow your wealth and skills."

**Prologue:**
Zeus asks: "Will you start in the Magic Garden of Spot Trading or brave the Treacherous Plains of Perpetuals?"

- **Magic Garden of Spot Trading:**
Poseidon: "Here, wealth grows slowly but steadily, like a gentle tide."
*ELI5*: Spot trading is simple. You buy and hold an asset, like planting a seed and waiting for it to grow.

- **Treacherous Plains of Perpetuals:**
Ares: "Massive rewards await those bold enough to tread here, but beware the risk of ruin!"
*ELI5*: Perpetuals are advanced contracts where you can profit even if the market drops. It‚Äôs like riding a chariot at full speed‚Äîthrilling but risky.
```

### Webhooks for Real-Time Notifications
